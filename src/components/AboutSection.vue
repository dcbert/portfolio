    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      With more than seven years of experience in software development, I specialize in designing and implementing smart
      factory applications.
      As Team Leader Smart Factory Applications at RÃ¶chling Automotive, I lead a team of software engineers to develop
      and deploy innovative solutions that optimize
      production processes, enhance product quality, and boost efficiency.
      I am deeply passionate about leveraging
      Python, JavaScript, and cutting-edge technologies like Django REST Framework, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL to create web
      applications that integrate seamlessly with factory systems, delivering real-time data and analytics to
      stakeholders.
