# Davide Bert - Software Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my expertise as a software developer with over seven years of experience, specializing in smart factory applications and team leadership.

I am deeply passionate about leveraging Python, JavaScript, and cutting-edge technologies like Django REST Framework, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL to create web applications that integrate seamlessly with factory systems, delivering real-time data and analytics to stakeholders.

This portfolio is built using Vue.js, featuring a UI designed to highlight my technical skills and professional journey.
